##########

The SMART WALK sole is a normal, ‘every-day’ shoe in-sole, laced with pressure sensors, stretch sensors, and various vibration motors.
The sensors record, and transmit data in order to establish a ‘walking baseline’ (through a database).
If the pattern suggests any deviation or uneven pressure applied to the sole, a silent vibration is activated to alert the person a fall may be imminent
